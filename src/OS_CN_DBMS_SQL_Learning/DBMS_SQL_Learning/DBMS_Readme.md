# DBMS SQL Learning
* Here also you can learn from scaler or gfg and later some videos to understand you can add accrodingly.
* Topicwise you can find in gfg and scaler
* Later interview questions list also you can find there only
* Extra learning also you can add here only. No Notes Dependencies. 

## WAY TO LEARN
* Just learn the interview pdf first. (As you already know most of the topics and can explain easily to interviewer)
* If any difficult topic then get it from the index topic wise below and youtube and done.
* No need to do very deep learning. As during interview you have to revise anyways.
* but if you not learn for long time then you have to restart always so.


## DBMS LEARNING TOPIC WISE (Follow any one series to learn)
* For now following GFG Topicwise : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/
* Scaler topicwise is this : https://www.scaler.com/topics/course/dbms/
### OTHER INFOS
* Notes in self notes also there. But it's not complete and not in topic wise.
* Get Scaler (Interviewbit) interview questions pdf here.
* Follow some series either for gfg or scaler or anywhere you can find better.
* Parallely do some youtube videos series for important difficult topics.
