# Don't be too dependent on notes, better be dependent upon your approach and ability to write that approach in code
## In this way only you can learn in long run. Destroy notes in long run, it will make you very dependent on it, 
## without you knowing the approach and your ability to write the code on your own.
### if something very new things also comes up then make temporary note and then write in here. in approach and code to revise
#### notes only dullying our mind

*/**

    1. Use of stringBuilder is more space-saving and good for appending rather than string concatenation.
        Concatenation is more time-consuming in string than appending in stringBuilder.


    2. Always start problem-solving by writing notes and code on paper, there you can always find optimized solutions : Always



    3. if (num==element){
            count+=1;   //This Saves more space than (count++ or Count=Count+1)
        }
      else{
            count-=1;  //This save more space than (count-- or Count=Count-1)
        }

* /**
* Never in your life now make notes for competitive programming solutions,
* whatever you already have is fine but not now
*
* Best way to learn competitive programming is learning question, understanding it, writing on a paper and trying to solve in that way first
* looking for discussions, looking for constraints and taking care of edge cases accordingly. so all this stuffs you can never find in
* notes of code and questions, specially in your leetcode notes also.
*
* So if you have anything to add in any problem. Now onwards we will be adding here in this repo only related to problems, solutions,
* anything new learning and DSA learning all can be kept here and can be accessed from everywhere
*
* You can also add those pdfs here, or share the link from drive stuff things.
*
* Probably slowly we are going to remove written notes and put all here. Either in code form with better and progressing expalanation
* or those best pages in form of PDF or CamScanner.
