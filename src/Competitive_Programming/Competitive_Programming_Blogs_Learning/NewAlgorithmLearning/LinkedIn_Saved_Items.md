Success is no accident.
It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying and most of all, the sacrifice of your comfort zone.
"A ship is always safe at the shore, but that is not what it is built for." - Albert Einstein
Life begins at the end of our comfort zone!

Failure, often deemed a dreaded outcome, is an integral part of the journey towards success. As Samuel Beckett eloquently put it, "Ever tried, ever failed, no matter. Try again, fail again, fail better." These words encapsulate the essence of perseverance and growth in the face of setbacks.🌠⚡

In a world that celebrates achievement and victory, failure is frequently shunned or hidden from view. Yet, history is riddled with examples of great minds who encountered repeated failures before reaching their zenith. Thomas Edison famously remarked, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work," highlighting his relentless spirit and commitment to progress.🌠⚡

The fear of failure often holds people back from pursuing their dreams. However, a shift in perspective can turn failure into a stepping stone rather than a stumbling block. Each setback is an opportunity to learn, adapt, and refine one's approach.💫Embracing failure fosters resilience, a trait that not only helps individuals weather challenges but also enables them to thrive in the face of adversity.⚡🌠

Innovation and growth stem from the willingness to push boundaries and explore uncharted territories. ⭐💫This invariably involves a degree of risk-taking, and with risk comes the possibility of failure. Consider the startup ecosystem, where failure is almost a rite of passage. Entrepreneurs who embrace failure as a learning experience often go on to create groundbreaking solutions that reshape industries.⚡
Failure teaches us humility and the importance of humility in the pursuit of excellence. It reminds us that no one is infallible and that the path to mastery is paved with errors and missteps. By openly acknowledging and addressing failures, individuals foster a culture of transparency and continuous improvement, which is vital for personal development and professional growth.🌠
Furthermore, failure builds character and empathy. Those who have experienced failure are better equipped to empathize with others facing similar challenges. This shared experience creates a sense of camaraderie and support that strengthens communities and encourages collaboration.⚡🌠
However, it's important to note that the transformative power of failure lies not in the act itself but in the response to it. Mere repetition of failed attempts won't necessarily lead to success. The critical component is the willingness to analyze what went wrong, identify areas for improvement, and then apply those insights to future endeavors.🌠⚡
In conclusion, the words of Samuel Beckett remind us that failure is not an end but a means to progress. By embracing failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, we unlock our potential for innovation, resilience, and personal development. The path to success is paved with failures that have been dissected, understood, and leveraged to move forward. So, let us embrace failure, not as a mark of defeat, but as a stepping stone on the journey to greatness.⚡🌠

▶️ 𝐋𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐨𝐟 𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: When people lack motivation, they may find it difficult to sustain their efforts and may give up on a task or goal.

▶️ 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐟𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐮𝐫𝐞: People may give up on something because they are afraid of failing or not meeting their own or others' expectations.

▶️ 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐦: Sometimes people can feel overwhelmed by the scale of a task or the number of things they need to do to achieve their goal. This can make them feel helpless and cause them to give up.

▶️ 𝐋𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐨𝐟 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬: If people feel like they are not making progress towards their goal, they may become discouraged and give up.

▶️ 𝐋𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐨𝐟 𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭: If people don't have the necessary support from others, such as friends or family, they may feel like they are on their own and give up.

▶️ 𝐃𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐫 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐬: People may give up on something if they find it too difficult or if they encounter challenges that they don't know how to overcome.

## System Design
25 𝐆𝐨𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐧 𝐑𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐢𝐧 𝐚 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰

1. If we are dealing with a read-heavy system, it's good to consider using a Cache.

2. If we need low latency in the system, it's good to consider using a Cache & CDN.

3. If we are dealing with a write-heavy system, it's good to use a Message Queue for Async processing

4. If we need a system to be ACID complaint, we should go for RDBMS or SQL Database

5. If data is unstructured & doesn't require ACID properties, we should go for NO-SQL Database

6. If the system has complex data in the form of videos, images, files etc, we should go for Blob/Object storage

7. If the system requires complex pre-computation like a news feed, we should use a Message Queue & Cache

8. If the system requires searching data in high volume, we should consider using a search index, tries or a search engine like Elasticsearch

9. If the system requires to Scale SQL Database, we should consider using Database Sharding

10. If the system requires High Availability, Performance, & Throughput, we should consider using a Load Balancer

11. If the system requires faster data delivery globally, reliability, high availability, & performance, we should consider using a CDN

12. If the system has data with nodes, edges, and relationships like friend lists, & road connections, we should consider using a Graph Database

13. If the system needs scaling of various components like servers, databases, etc, we should consider using Horizontal Scaling

14. If the system requires high-performing database queries, we should use Database Indexes

15. If the system requires bulk job processing, we should consider using Batch Processing & Message Queues

16. If the system requires reducing server load and preventing DOS attacks, we should use a Rate Limiter

17. If the system has microservices, we should consider using an API Gateway (Authentication, SSL Termination, Routing etc)

18. If the system has a single point of failure, we should implement Redundancy in that component

19. If the system needs to be fault-tolerant, & durable, we should implement Data Replication (creating multiple copies of data on different servers)

20. If the system needs user-to-user communication (bi-directional) in a fast way, we should use Websockets

21. If the system needs the ability to detect failures in a distributed system, we should implement a Heartbeat

22. If the system needs to ensure data integrity, we should use Checksum Algorithm

23. If the system needs to transfer data between various servers in a decentralized way, we should go for the Gossip Protocol

24. If the system needs to scale servers with add/removal of nodes efficiently, with no hotspots, we should implement Consistent Hashing

25. If the system needs anything to deal with a location like maps, nearby resources, we should consider using Quadtree, Geohash, etc
