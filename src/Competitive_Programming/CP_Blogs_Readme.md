### 3. Some Algorithms Approach to Learn about
* 1. Count Derangements (so that no items is in original Position)
* 2. Water Jug Problem, given two jug without litre marking on them of size 5 litre and 3 litre, find out 4 litre quantity from them
  * You can either empty the whole jug, full the jug or pour from one jug to another. only these three steps are possible/permitted
* 3. kadane'e Algorithm : Maximum Sum Subarray
    * Link to learn : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/
    * link to learn : https://www.javatpoint.com/kadanes-algorithm
* 4. Sieve of Eratosthenes : Find all prime numbers from 1 to n
  * Approach : iterate from i=2 to root(n);
  * link : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes/
  * Time Complexity : O(n * Log(Log(n)))
* 5. KMP Algorithm for Pattern Matching

### 4. Some very tricky basic questions of competitive programming
* 1. Reverse an array without using extra space or another array
  * Just do swapping
  * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-reverse-an-array-or-string/
  * here time - O(N) and space O(1);
* 2. Find the missing number, for given a array containing 1 to N numbers missing one between them
    * Approach use sum formula : n(n+1)/2 - ArraySum = Missing number
