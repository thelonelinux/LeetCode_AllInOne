# Graph Learning
* Strivers Complete DSA Learning with different pattern types and problem solved link
* https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/
* All videos problem link for each patter problem typs : 
* https://www.youtube.com/@takeUforward/playlists
* Remember participating in contest in must to up skill your problem solving skills


## Graph Learning Process
* Basic starts from representing the graph and then it's two main traversal viz BFS and DFS, 
* After that you solve as many questions you can using this graph representation and traversal


### Graph important learning links, (more important is you should be able to understand approach and then write code and explain)
* https://www.programiz.com/dsa/graph
* Following youtube videos by striver link below
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3_pLsDdeuU&list=PLgUwDviBIf0oE3gA41TKO2H5bHpPd7fzn&ab_channel=takeUforward
* https://takeuforward.org/graph/introduction-to-graph/
* for notes check above link
* Leetcode links for some graph problems and approach : 
* https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/655708/Graph-For-Beginners-Problems-or-Pattern-or-Sample-Solutions
* Don't make note of these things and no need to take printout
* just learn the approach, write the code as per your understanding and explaining way. first you can see in youtube, then write approach and then code thing
* In here only you can find link for exploring other DSA topics like linkedlist, tree etc.


#### Solve as many as problem in Graph Competitive Programming to understand it's working and get ready with competitive programming



#### Graph self notes pdf provided here only contain the basic level graph implementation and traversal way of bfs and dfs
