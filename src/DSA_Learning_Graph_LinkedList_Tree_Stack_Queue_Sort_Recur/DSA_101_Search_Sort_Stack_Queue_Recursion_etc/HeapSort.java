     * In max heap, our main purpose is to bring max element in root node, and child node should be less than parent's node

    /**
     * Simply approach is we will be given array, it's size n, and index i which is index of sub-tree whose heapify we have to do
     * So this parent node (i = arr[i]) will have two child i.e. (2*i+1 and 2*i+2) which is index of child nodes.
     * Now from this three index we have to find the largest value, swap the largest value at parent node if it is find in child node.
     * and assign it's index as largest. so that this child can be send later to heapify again recursively, as this sub-tree is affected.
     * so in this way our max heap will be build for that sub-tree (i)
     *
     * to build heap for whole array, we have to iterate for whole arr from i=n/2-1 to 0, (because if array size is 10, then n/2-1=4, i.e. 4th index of child in it
     * rest of the above index array won't have child, so we start from bottom up manner.
     * and in any index if the child was swapped to parent or sub-tree node, then within it inner recursive heap is called because that sub-tree was affected.
