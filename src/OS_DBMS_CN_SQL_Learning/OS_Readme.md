* Includes learning related to OS

## OS
### PHYSICAL NOTES COPY
* For beginner notes see your physical saved notes.
* But need to make a full fledged topic wise notes
* .
### INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
* Later we also need OS whole interview questions from Interviewbit to learn.
* But you first understand and learn proper notes then only go throught the learning of interviewbit questions for practise.
